		Søren Kierkegaard made one observation that stuck out to me: That there is torture in genius. One does not achieve such a status voluntarily, because genius is a curse, not a blessing.
	</p>
	<p>
		The cult of genius forms because they are individuals who stand in full view of the timeless awareness that penetrates the myopia humans are so often afflicted with. We revere them because through them, we are able to glimpse, even for a moment, the illuminating, transcendental reality that underlies the sensible world. They are the messengers that stand at the boundary of the human world, and the realm of Platonic perfection.
	</p>
	<p>
		And in occupying that position, they are torn asunder. Each dimension exerts a magnetism. Yet the genius is doomed to occupy the maw that divides the worlds. They must have one foot on each side. They can never integrate into the world of humanity because their abilities doom them to never be understood. To be alone. Neither can they trespass into the other domain, because they are only human. And is a human permitted to ascend to godhood?
	</p>
	<p>
		Thus the exalted genius is only a slave. Whilst we as ordinary people frolic about the meadows as free individuals, the genius is constrained along the one-dimensional path, never allowed to deviate. They have no companion in their journey, no reprieve from their task as a messenger. They must be afflicted with that inevitable, terrifying loneliness, condemned to forge deeper forevermore.
