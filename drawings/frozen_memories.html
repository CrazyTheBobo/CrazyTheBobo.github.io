					This was a deeply personal drawing. Through it I was attempting to process many things, many feelings and unresolved questions in my heart. I had reached a point where it felt as if my world had become frozen, static - and that the only way to move beyond it was by externalising it. In it I had sought a perfect mirror of my world, but perfection is always an elusive thing; The more you try for it, the more it lingers just beyond your reach. And the more difficult it becomes.
