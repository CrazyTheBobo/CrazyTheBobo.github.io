						Søren Kierkegaard made one observation that stuck out to me: That there is torture in genius. One does not achieve such a status voluntarily, because genius is a curse, not a blessing.
					</p>
					<p>
						The cult of genius forms because they are individuals who stand in full view of the timeless awareness that penetrates the myopia humans are so often afflicted with. We revere them because through them, we are able to glimpse, even for a moment, the illuminating, transcendental reality that underlies the sensible world. They are the messengers that stand at the boundary of the human world, and the realm of Platonic perfection.
					</p>
					<p>
						And in occupying that position, they are torn asunder. Each dimension exerts a magnetism. Yet the genius is doomed to occupy the maw that divides the worlds. They must have one foot on each side. They can never integrate into the world of humanity because their abilities doom them to never be understood. To be alone. Neither can they trespass into the other domain, because they are only human. And is a human permitted to ascend to godhood?
					</p>
					<p>
						Thus the exalted genius is only a slave. Whilst we as ordinary people frolic about the meadows as free individuals, the genius is constrained along the one-dimensional path, never allowed to deviate. They have no companion in their journey, no reprieve from their task as a messenger. They must be afflicted with that inevitable, terrifying loneliness, condemned to forge deeper forevermore.

					<h3 class="monologue-title">The ontological implications of the Copenhagen and Many World Interpretations</h3>

						Both interpretations can be approached from either a physical or mathematical angle. In the macro world, the Copenhagen interpretation tells us of the random recording of a single (and thereafter consistent) value upon the exposure of a system in superposition to observation. Mathematically, it is the selection of a single eigenvalue, corresponding to the collapse of an original wavefunction as expressed by a linear combination of an orthogonal basis set of eigenfunctions, by the measuring apparatus.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Many World Interpretation is exceedingly difficult to describe mathematically. To do so, we would have to seek some way to numerically describe the duplication of all wavefunctions in the known universe in a simultaneous process across allspace, accompanied by the desymmetrization of a single wavefunction of interest - the one measured. Given our rudimentary understanding of even the concepts of simultaneity, as outlined in Einstein’s theories of relativity, human intellect as it is now is ill-equipped to dissect the nuances.
					</p>
					<p>
						Faced with the terrifying insurmountability of this barrier, the only thing we can turn to for solace is the world of linguistics. “The truth always carries with it the ambiguity of the words used to describe it” - but here the ambiguity is necessary, indeed unavoidable. As a related corollary, I have not the hubris to suggest I could begin my discussion without hiding behind the comfortable multivalency of the words I use to communicate my thoughts. So it is that for now, we shall have to abandon the conquest of this dilemma from a mathematical perspective.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Copenhagen and Many Worlds Interpretations have long been perceived as mutually orthogonal interpretations of quantum physics, but I maintain that that is not the case. At first glance the Copenhagen interpretation carries with it a greater air of resignation, an overture of agnosticism, while the Many Worlds Interpretation strains towards a determinism that seeks to escape from the frightening anarchy that uncertainty brings. But the latter does not truly succeed. While any single consciousness observes a deterministic universe, the uncertainty lies in which consciousness we, as the individual, occupy. Each of infinite auxiliary universes represent a symmetrical version of a single conscious entity - indeed a superposition in the same sense that we use the word for wavefunctions.
					</p>
					<p>
						Thus we see that neither proposition escapes from God’s game of dice. They differ ontologically only in the distribution of uncertainty between two variables - consciousness and measurement. Affixing one necessarily leads to the probabilistic expansion of the other. Then the question becomes not whether uncertainty is an inherent feature of the universe (the answer is yes), but rather how it manifests.
					</p>
					<p>
						But then, even this question makes no difference from a <u>personal</u> perspective. Previously I had described the parallel universes predicted by the Many Worlds Theory as auxiliary. Should we concede that no interaction could ever occur between universes, perhaps due to some kind of mutual exclusion not unlike Heisenberg uncertainty for position and momentum, the term “auxiliary” is indeed reduced to “irrelevant”. There is no need to vest upon them any ontological significance because they are unknowable, not even existing in the same dimension of existence as our universe. We care about the uncertainty of a particle, and the superposition of Schrodinger’s cat, because they exist in our sensible world. Such cannot be said for the parallel worlds. To do so is an exercise in futility.

						Somehow, Marcus Aurelius has a very soothing way of writing. Succinct, direct, and to the point. Frequently making use of short sentences. Yet at the same time, that results in a kind of reassuring certainty, a gentle sureness in his speech. Even in the moments when he is questioning himself.
					</p>
					<p>
						What I find the most extraordinary about this man is the fact that he was, as a Roman Emperor, <em>effectively omnipotent</em>. He had access to bottomless riches, all the various forms of hedonistic pleasures, whatever he could have imagined that was within the laws of physics. He had unfathomable power, which I had always held would inevitably corrupt a person, make them give in to the basest human vices. Yet Marcus Aurelius was a person who overcame that weakness, who led a life of moral uprightness and virtue.
					</p>
					<p>
						In other words, he is, to date, the sole antithesis to my belief that <em>humans are innately evil</em>.

						What is Monster about? And what is it about the series that prompted me to write down my thoughts as I did for Evangelion?
					</p>
					<p>
						Monster is frequently marketed as a crime/psychological thriller, but I think at its core, it is a profoundly philosophical work that forces us into dialogues on the nature of humanity. “What did Naoki Urasawa understand about evil, to create <em>Monster</em>?” My journey into this universe began when I became acquainted with Johan Liebert. That pale-skinned, tranquil, elegant and almost tender man - and the perfect embodiment of evil, the perfect antagonist. Yet by the final episodes, he had evolved to become so much more. He was a vessel, pregnant with so many symbolic roles.

					<p>
						Ruhenheim, truly, is where everything is tied together in the end. Character development occurred at an explosive rate. There was revelation - Roberto as another orphan in 511 Kinderheim, Johan’s intentions of a perfect suicide. Tragedy - the death of Grimmer, how close he had been to uniting with Roberto and telling each other their real names. Reconciliation - Tenma’s return to being a doctor, Anna forgiving Johan at last. It was a maelstrom of emotions and a masterclass in storytelling.

						Yes, in the grand scheme of things I very much see nihilism as a half-complete philosophy, in the sense that there is total destruction - of values, moral compasses, meaning and subjective experience - without anything to fill the void.
					</p>
					<p>
						It's like the sceptics - by taking their "dogmatic doubt" to its logical conclusion, we end up at solipsism - where nothing can ever be known, not even our own existence. but that is all the sceptics leave us with: and it is so unsatisfying a conclusion! which perhaps is why it was not widely adopted.
					</p>
					<p>
						In contrast, take Descartes' philosophy - "<em>cogito, ergo sum</em>". It signifies the place where Descartes had reached absolute solipsism, and had unveiled the only truth he can be certain of - "I may doubt everything, even the reality of what my senses tell me, but by the act of doubting I must be thinking. Thus, the only thing doubt cannot eradicate is my thought, making that the original truth of which I can be certain of - "I think, therefore I am"."
					</p>
					<p>
						Where he ventures beyond scepticism is his subsequent constructive philosophy, where he builds up an empirical philosophy based on his original premise, and that's really what made it so powerful and influential. Descartes filled the void subsequently, and thus enabled a school of thought that could be analysed, criticised, built upon.

						“If we deny the need for thought, Moneo, as some do, we lose the powers of reflection; we cannot define what our senses report. If we deny the flesh, we unwheel the vehicle which bears us.

						This thought arose from a connection made between two homonymous words: sublime, and subliminal.
					</p>
					<p>
						Discussing the sublime, as Roald Hoffmann attempts in <em>Beyond the Finite</em>, is exceedingly difficult, something that I may endeavour later and most likely stumble and struggle with. This is because what we describe as sublime is often a <em>subliminal</em> experience, a vague emotion evoked. It emerges as a gestalt of nuances, resistant to being pried and isolated into independent ingredients.

						It is a rare thing that a person is both a talented scientist and an able, adept wordsmith, but that is who this Nobel Laureate was. To me, his essays are so enjoyable to read because it unites two of my great loves - that for the science of chemistry, and for the remarkable eloquence of human conversation. With his wordsmithing abilities, he elevates his thoughts to a dimension that transcends a mere relaying of information. Indeed, it takes on an air of sublimity.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have little doubt that both dimensions of Roald Hoffmann mutually complement and elevate each other. The ability to express yourself enriches your inner world and hence enhances the clarity of your logical reasoning. Conversely, the intimate acquaintance with science and the knowledge derived from it offers an enlightened perspective of the world that reinforces your personal philosophy.

						I was reading up on cobalt and Vitamin B12, and a thought suddenly occurred to me: Why has it taken so long to expand the field of organometallic chemistry? Nature, after all, provides no small set of examples of organometallic compounds, often strikingly similar to the structures of synthetic equivalents. For example, the Fe2+ centre in haemoglobin and cytochrome, The Co2+ corrin system in Vitamin B12, the V in bromoperoxidase, the Mn in reverse transcriptase enzymes…
					</p>
					<p>
						Of course, observing its existence is an entirely different matter from pioneering it as a field. Or maybe this is simply the power of hindsight - connections are much easier to make when looking back in time. Still, it does make me wonder how much more we can learn from our very own biology.

					<p>
						Something I have been mulling over is - is rationality and emotion incompatible? Is one necessarily the antithesis of the other?
					</p>
					<p>
						Now, I would say no. It is rational to accommodate one's emotions. Certainly, one would succeed in many professions and many facets of life if they discarded their feelings - say stock market trading, data analyst, spending money on frivolous distractions. I thought of what it would be like to be a machine capable of assimilating knowledge at a relentlessly consistent pace yet still possessing that human capacity for creativity (in the traditional sense, at least), and my first instinct was "woah, that would be impressive".
					</p>
					<p>
						But embracing your emotions play a role <strong>when it deals events or decisions concerning one's future emotional state</strong>. For example, no amount of rigorous logic can help you find a lifelong partner as effectively as simply being open to your heart and being honest with yourself.
					</p>
					<p>
						The implicit assumption, perhaps, is that one can never fully discard emotion in the course of their life. And so, it becomes rational to accommodate it, and to insulate your rational side from it as much as possible when needed simply by maintaining a healthy inner balance, lest one day suppressed desires and regrets overwhelm you, and render you victim to destructive impulses. Essentially, it is pre-emption of such future situations without being overly accommodative in the present term.
					</p>
					<p>
						Perhaps the only situation in which <em>logos</em> and <em>pathos</em> can be fully divorced is when one can achieve the extreme of fully isolating the inborn emotive side of themselves, as is the case with psychopaths, and be able to do so for life. But all in all, that is perhaps only an ideal (or maybe to some, an unlikely damnation) for the majority of us.

					<p>
						Honestly... I really don't understand the concept of work-life balance. Why is a distinction made at all?
					</p>
					<p>
						There is a fundamental paradox that has been observed: that some of our best moments arise when we are wholly absorbed in some challenging work-related task, and yet we still perceive "commitments" to be something undesirable. To be removed from our path to achieving leisure.
					</p>
					<p>
						And yet, leisure time rarely feels as satisfying. Watching Netflix, stoning on the couch - they may be comfortable, or even pleasurable, but the depth of experience remains substantially less complex than when we achieve a flow state. Simply put, leisure is less fulfilling.
					</p>
					<p>
						So why do we still perceive work as a means to an end? Why is it difficult to embrace it as an autotelic phenomenon - one that is self-sufficient, whose very existence justifies itself?

					<p>
						By treating such events like exams and homework as necessary evils before we arrive at the delayed gratification, we are invalidating a large part of our lives.
